# WIO Plant Monitor 
The WIO Plant Monitor is uses external sensors (humidity, temperature, light, soil moisture) to monitor the wellbeing of any plant. These 'plant statistics' are displayed both numerically and graphically on the WIO monitor and can be customized for each plant. In response to the current light and soil moisture conditions, the plant monitor also drives a servo motor that can turn on or off a device with misting and light capabilities.
