# Jumbo Space Invaders
Jumbo Space Invaders is a video game based on Space Runs with a WIO Terminal + LEGO SPIKE Prime interface. The user controls an elephant that shoots pellets out of its trunk in order to try and destroy a descending level of space aliens. The LEGO motor and force sensor serve as the controls, and the WIO displays the graphics on its screen.
