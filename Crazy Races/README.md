# Crazy Line Races
The Crazy Line Races assignment involved building and programming a line following robot that can race on a road network indicated by tape on the ground and requires the robot to stop if there is an obstacle in its way. The robot used a light sensor programmed with a proportional controller to follow the line, and stops/beeps when the ultrasonic sensor detects an obstacle in the way.
