# ME35
This repository contains all the code and video links to the projects completed in Chris Rogers' Intro to Robotics Class during the Spring '21 semester. The main software and hardware used for this class include:

- LEGO SPIKE Prime Robotics Kit 
- Raspberry Pi & Pi Camera
- WIO Terminal 
- Arduino/C++
- Python & MicroPython
- HTML

## Projects overview 

#### WIO Plant Monitor 
WIO Terminal controlled plant monitor that retrieves plant statistics from various external sensors and drives a servo motor to turn on/off a mister/light source in response to plant conditions. 
- WIO Terminal + Arduino 
- Integrated hardware + software system 

#### Jumbo Space Run
LEGO SPIKE Prime + WIO Terminal video game interface, inspired by Space Invaders. Users control the game using LEGO sensors and the game is graphically displayed on the WIO screen.
